# Avaloki: Use TTS Through Your Microphone

## What is Avaloki?

Avaloki is a MacOS-only application that allows you to type in a message and have it be spoken out loud through a virtual microphone. This can be useful for people who cannot use their microphoneor temporarily (loud environment like a car or bus) or permenantly (low quality or non-existent) or people who do not have their voice temporarily (illness or side-effects) or permenantly (disability or condition).  
![A screenshot of the Avaloki dashboard. It is pink with multiple buttons and dropdown menus for various options.](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7731fa8f-a9e4-429e-8c0a-97d90b5e4324)

## What do all of those buttons do?

Avaloki has a lot of features!

- Playing through the virtual microphone or bulit-in audio output (to test your messages)
- Choosing between five different voices that you select during the start-up process
- Three different speed settings
- A button to play a test message through built-in audio to test your new settings
- A teal Replay Message button to replay your last sent message (with new setting if you have changed it)
- A red Emergency Stop button to cut off Avaloki immediately
- An automatic blocker to make sure only one message plays at a time
- A buttont to go back through the tutorial and set-up process if something isn't working correctly.

## Why is Avaloki only on MacOS yet doesn't have noterization?

Avaloki is only on MacOS as of now because I've only found a way to access native TTS capabilities in MacOS. It doesn't have noterization because it costs $100 _per year_ and requires XCode and... a bunch of other stuff I don't currently have the time for. So to run it you have to make it manually bypass GateKeeper. I wish it was better too.

## How to Download and Run Avaloki (MacOS Only)

Avaloki requires Loopback or a similar Virtual Audio Cable to work. Once more:

So make sure to download that now or when you come to that point in the Tutorial.

1. Download the lastest relase of Avaloki from the Releases side bar on the right.
