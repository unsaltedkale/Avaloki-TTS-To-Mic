# Avaloki: Use TTS Through Your Microphone

## What is Avaloki?

Avaloki is a MacOS-only application that allows you to type in a message and have it be spoken out loud through a virtual microphone. This can be useful for people who cannot use their microphoneor temporarily (loud environment like a car or bus) or permenantly (low quality or non-existent) or people who do not have their voice temporarily (illness or side-effects) or permenantly (disability or condition).

## What do all of those buttons do?

Avaloki has a lot of features!

- Playing through the virtual microphone or bulit-in audio output (to test your messages)
- Choosing between five different voices that you select during the start-up process
- Three different speed settings
- A button to play a test message through built-in audio to test your new settings
- A teal Replay Message button to replay your last sent message (with new setting if you have changed it)
- A red Emergency Stop button to cut off Avaloki immediately
- An automatic blocker to make sure only one message plays at a time
- A buttont to go back through the tutorial and set-up process if something isn't working correctly.

## Why is Avaloki only on MacOS yet doesn't have noterization?

Avaloki is only on MacOS as of now because I've only found a way to access native TTS capabilities in MacOS. It doesn't have noterization because it costs $100 _per year_ and requires XCode and... a bunch of other stuff I don't currently have the time for. So to run it you have to make it manually bypass GateKeeper. I wish it was better too.

## Why is it called Avaloki?

Avaloki is named after AvalokiteÅ›vara, a Bodhisattva in Buddhism. They are the Bodhisattva of compassion, hearing the cries of the world and helping whenever and wherever they can. I feel like they were a fitting namesake for an application that gives a voice to people who may not have one.

## How to Download and Run Avaloki (MacOS Only)

Avaloki requires Loopback or a similar Virtual Audio Cable to work. Once more:

So make sure to download that now or when you come to that point in the Tutorial.

1. Download the lastest relase of Avaloki from the Releases side bar on the right.

2. Unzip the file if it didn't automatically unzip and attempt to open it.

3. You should see an error as shown above. Click OK.

4. Go to System Preferences, and then to Security & Privacy (_Screenshots were taken on a old MacOS because my computer is old, GUI has changed on more recent versions._)

5. Under General, click Open Anyway next to the message talking about Avaloki being blocked.

6. Another message will pop up. Press Open.

7. Avaloki should boot up and be fully functioning! Follow the on-screen instructions to make it fully working. It will involve downloading Loopback (or another VAC if you are knowledgeable) and two very simple terminal commands that just show data you have to input.
